# Sentiment Analysis Project 😀😐😡

This Sentiment Analysis project, developed during my *internship* at **Coding Raja Technologies**, employs a diverse set of machine learning techniques to analyze and categorize sentiments in textual data. The project features a comprehensive approach, utilizing deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Conv1D (1D Convolutional Neural Network), and Bidirectional LSTM, along with traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM (Support Vector Machine).

To use the streamlit based web app, where I deployed my model :-

```
pyhton -m streamlit run get_sentiment.py
```
